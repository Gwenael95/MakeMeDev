# MakeMeDev
2020 Web project at Coding factory, MakeMeDev aim to allow users
to post and search functions from other developers.

#Sign in user
    
Signed in user will create an account with mail, pseudo, password.
It will allow to post new functions to solve a problematic.

This user will have to :
-   give a name to his function
-   describe the function, how it works, which problem it solve ...
-   define all arguments and returns values :
    -   type 
    -   name 
    -   description
    -   default value (`for arguments, not required`)
-   add tags

Other signed in users may propose to enhance this function,
they just have to add a post on the function they want.
The rest of the community will elect the optimal solution by voting 
thanks to like and dislike.

This will allow every user, even if not registered, to find solution to
their issues thanks to the dev community.
